# Flower with Tub Assignment

This project involves designing a 3D model of a flower planted in a tub. Each component of the model is built using basic geometric shapes to create a cohesive and realistic structure. Below is an overview of each element involved in the design.

## Project Structure

### 1. Tub Design
The tub serves as the base structure of the flower model:
- **Shape**: The tub is modeled as a polygonal container.
- **Details**: Additional details, such as rims or handles, are included to give the tub character and realism.
- **Purpose**: The tub anchors the flower and gives the model a planted appearance.

### 2. Flower Stems
The stems extend from the tub and support the flower:
- **Shape**: Stem is represented by elongated cylinders with slight bends to mimic a natural look.
<!-- - **Leaves**: Small leaf shapes, like ovals or triangles, are added along the stem for additional detail. -->

### 3. Petals
Petals form the main body of the flower:
- **Arrangement**: Individual petal shapes are created and arranged in a radial pattern around the flower center.
- **Variations**: Petals are slightly varied in size, angle, and shape for an organic appearance.
- **Color**: Petals are colored to enhance the model's visual appeal.

<!-- ### 4. Center of the Flower
The center acts as the core or pollen area:
- **Shape**: A small circular or dome-like structure is placed at the flower's core.
- **Texture**: Textures or bumps can be added to simulate pollen or fine detail. -->

<!-- ### 5. Shading and Lighting
Shading and lighting add depth to the flower and tub:
- **Shading**: Applied to the flower and tub to make them look three-dimensional.
- **Lighting**: Proper light positioning enhances the appearance of each component, highlighting the flower's structure.

### 6. Additional Elements (Optional)
- **Soil or Textures**: A soil texture inside the tub creates a more natural, planted look.
- **Color Variations**: Different colors for petals, stem, and tub can make the model visually engaging and realistic. -->

## Summary
The "Flower with Tub" model is built using a combination of simple geometric shapes and lighting techniques to create a lifelike structure. Each part of the flower and tub works together to make a cohesive, visually appealing 3D model.
